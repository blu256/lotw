# Link of the Week Bot
The **Link of the Week Bot** (short: Link Bot, or LOTW) is a Mastodon bot which posts one random link per week  from a manually-curated list. The link can be practically anything: a website, an article, a Gemini capsule,  an IRC link, a file on an FTP server...

The official bot instance is [@linkoftheweek@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@linkoftheweek).
