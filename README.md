# ðŸ”— Link of the Week Bot
The **Link of the Week Bot** (short: Link Bot, or LOTW) is a Mastodon bot which posts one random link per week  from a manually-curated list. The link can be practically anything: a website, an article, a Gemini capsule,  an IRC link, a file on an FTP server...

The official bot instance is [@linkoftheweek@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@linkoftheweek).

## Contributing
Send in your links (and short descriptions of them) to the bot account ([@linkoftheweek@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@linkoftheweek)), me ([@blu256@koyu.space](https://koyu.space/@blu256)) or create a PR with your proposed additions to `sitecat.txt`.

Code contributions are also welcome.

## Content policy
Your link(s) have to be approved before they can be merged into the `sitecat.txt` file.

Things you should keep in mind when submitting links:

* The links you submit *should* point to some interesting and/or fun content;
* The links you submit *should* not be duplicates of existing links or their content;
* You *should avoid* submitting links to content that concerns topics like politics and religion;
* You *should not* submit links to content that is disturbing, sexual or illegal, or could serve to harass or stigmatize a person or a social group;

Reasoning and a sense of proportion should be applied to the above rules.
