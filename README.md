# ðŸ”— Link of the Day Bot
The **Links of the Day Bot** (short: Link Bot, or LOTD) is a Mastodon bot which posts one random link per run from a manually-curated list. The link can be practically anything: a website, an article, a Gemini capsule,  an IRC link, a file on an FTP server...

The official bot instance is [@linkoftheweek@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@linkoftheweek).

It used to run once a week (hence the old Link Of The Week name) but the official instance is currently posting links daily.

**Link submissions and other contributions are welcome.**

## Submitting links
Links can be to any sort of content that is interesting, accessible through any popular Internet protocol (HTTP, Gemini, Gopher, FTP etc.)

The submission process is very easy. Your link(s) have to be approved to comply with the rules (see below) before they can be added to the catalog, but it's highly likely that your link(s) will be added to the catalog the same day.

You can send your links in one of the following ways:
- a message (of any kind) to the bot account ([@linkoftheweek@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@linkoftheweek));
- a message (of any kind) to the curator ([@blu256@koyu.space](https://koyu.space/@blu256));
- a pull request on GitHub.

You can optionally supply short descriptions for your submission(s).

## Content policy
**tl;dr** Just use your sense of reason on what content is interesting and not disturbing.

Things you should keep in mind when submitting links:

* The links you submit *should* point to some interesting and/or fun content;
* The links you submit *should* not be duplicates of existing links or their content;
* You *should avoid* submitting links to content that concerns topics like politics and religion;
* You *should avoid* submitting links to content that is bound to get out of date or less interesting over time (e.g. news, software releases and changelogs etc.);
* You *should not* submit links to content that is disturbing, sexual or illegal, or could serve to harass or stigmatize a person or a social group;
* The language of the official instance (and hence of the list) is English. Please *avoid* links to content in other languages.

Reasoning and a sense of proportion should be applied to the above rules.

## License
The code and site catalog are released into the Public Domain.

You are welcome to fork this repository and create your own instance of the bot, provided that you change the bot's name. For example, names like "Link of the Week in Esperanto" and "The Scientific Link of the Week" would be pretty acceptable (and very cool too!).
