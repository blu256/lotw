- Link of the Day Throwback
  - looks for link of the day at this day in the previous year
  - posts it earlier than the canonical link of the week
  - allows repeating links that people might have missed without having to set them LOTD a second time
  - needs to grep for "Link of the [week|day] YYYY-MM-DD" and parse the dates.
